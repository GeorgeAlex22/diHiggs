## LHAPDF
This analysis uses LHAPDF-6.1.2 which has been installed in the $HOME directory. 
It is needed for compiling and running main.x in ./hhDilep_pseudoanasol/ 

```
    gmake clean && gmake main.x && ./main.x 
```

You can install LHAPDF-6.1.2 by running

```
    source /bin/installLHAPDF-6.1.2.csh     
```

## Delphes
In order to run the Selection.C root script and installation of Delphes-3.4.0 in the $HOME directory is needed.
You can install it by running 

```
    source /bin/installDelphes-3.4.0.csh 
```

For me, it works with ROOT 6.06/06 and gcc 4.9.1 which I load form lxplus.
If you are not on lxplus, it should work by just downloading these versions on your local machine
and editing the appropriate lines in DelphesEnv.csh and installDelphes.csh
